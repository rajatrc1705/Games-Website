# Games-Site

This project is the result of an academic team project. The project itself is a website, which has some exciting and iconic games coded up from scratch 
by me and my team-mates, to allow people to have a fun free-time. The games included in this site are Rock-Paper-Scissors (playing against a computer through a webcam), Connect 4, Hand Cricket (playing against a computer through a webcam), and a Quiz Application with quizes on exciting topics. This project is somewhat in its beta stages and more features are yet to be added.
