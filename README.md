# Games-Site

This project is the result of an academic team project. The project itself is a website, which has some exciting and iconic games coded up from scratch 
by me and my team-mates, to allow people to have a fun free-time. The games included in this site are Rock-Paper-Scissors (playing against a computer through a webcam), Connect 4, Hand Cricket (playing against a computer through a webcam), and a Quiz Application with quizes on exciting topics. This project is somewhat in its beta stages and more features are yet to be added.

# Build Status

# Technologies Used

- Django
- Tensorflow.js
- JavaScript
- Ajax
- HTML

This repository contains only the Quiz part of the game-site and does the job of integrating all the other games at one place through the live links of the respective games.
The respositories for the Rock-Paper-Scissors, Connect 4 and Hand-Cricket are on the Github accounts of the other team-mates as follows:
- [Apoorv Gupta](https://github.com/apoorvgupta11) - Rock-Paper-Scissors
- [Atharva Dave]() - Connect 4
- [Sounak Das](https://github.com/sounak1407) - Hand-Cricket

# Features

These games although available on some other sites are unique in their own ways and have some different features, for example integrating and playing through a web camera, showing a cumulative leaderboard for the quizes, and different levels of difficulty for the Connect 4 game.

# Deployment

This project is deployed on Heroku
