# Games-Site 🎯🏓
<hr>

This project is the result of an academic team project. The project itself is a website, which has some exciting and iconic games coded up from scratch 
by me and my team-mates, to allow people to have a fun free-time. The games included in this site are Rock-Paper-Scissors (playing against a computer through a webcam), Connect 4, Hand Cricket (playing against a computer through a webcam), and a Quiz Application with quizes on exciting topics. This project is somewhat in its beta stages and more features are yet to be added.

## Technologies Used 👩‍💻

- Django
- Tensorflow.js
- JavaScript
- Ajax
- HTML

This repository contains only the Quiz part of the game-site and does the job of integrating all the other games at one place through the live links of the respective games.
The respositories for the <b>Rock-Paper-Scissors</b>, <b>Connect 4</b> and <b>Hand-Cricket</b> are on the Github accounts of the other team-mates as follows:
- [Apoorv Gupta](https://github.com/apoorvgupta11) - Rock-Paper-Scissors  🥌📰✂
- [Atharva Dave]() - Connect 4 🎰
- [Sounak Das](https://github.com/sounak1407) - Hand-Cricket ✋🏏

## Features 💫

 - These games although available on some other sites are unique in their own ways and have some different features
 - For example integrating and playing through a web camera
 - Showing a cumulative leaderboard for the quizes
 - Different levels of difficulty for the Connect 4 game.

My contribution to this project is:<br>
 - Making Quiz component of the website, with leaderboard 📈 as a new and different feature
 - Making the login and sign-up, and other pages and design features required by the main website
 - Deploying the entire project to Heroku cloud service (PaaS).
